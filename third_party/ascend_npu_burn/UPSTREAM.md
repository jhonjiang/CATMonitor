# Ascend NPU Burn upstream record

The files under `source/` are vendored from the official
MindCluster AscendNPUBurn repository so a CATMonitor source archive contains
the NPU stress implementation required by `features/stress`.

The source tree was compared byte-for-byte with the Git blobs at the recorded
revision. A previously available ZIP contained nine additional legacy
documentation files that were not tracked by this revision; those files were
not imported because they could not be attributed to the fixed Git tree.

The complete tracked tree is stored directly rather than as a Git submodule,
a build-time download, or an opaque archive. This keeps CATMonitor source
archives self-contained on restricted nodes, makes the reviewed source visible
in the same change, and allows offline checksum verification. Upstream tests,
documentation, and development metadata are retained because removing them
would create a CATMonitor-specific source fork; GitHub marks the tree as
vendored so it does not distort repository language statistics.

Generic CATMonitor CI verifies the exact file set, checksums, wheel build,
installation, imports, image metadata, and CATMonitor integration. It does not
claim to run upstream tests that require a compatible CANN/torch_npu stack and
physical NPU. Those workload gates remain explicit A2/A3 node acceptance.

Mulan PSL v2 permits distribution in source or executable form when recipients
receive a copy of the license and the copyright, patent, trademark, and
disclaimer statements are retained. The vendored component remains under its
upstream license and is not relicensed under the CATMonitor Apache-2.0 license.

CATMonitor compatibility changes must not be edited into `source/`. Store an
audited patch under `scripts/stress/patches/ascend_npu_burn/` and apply it only
to the isolated build snapshot. The initial A3 build profile is `none`, which
applies no patch.

When updating upstream:

1. review the new revision and its license/notice files;
2. replace `source/` with an exact archive of one immutable commit;
3. update both this document and the machine-readable `UPSTREAM` file;
4. run the NPU image-builder DFX tests and A2/A3 compatibility acceptance;
5. publish the change only after the runtime image and cleanup paths pass.
